## Features (so far):
* Monthly calendar view with Smart-Snapshots
* Ability to draw and save daily notes

## Features in the pipeline:
* Indicator (small dot?) in the calendar view that lets you know that you have items journaled for that day
* Custom pages / book styles 
* Various pen styles + colours / eraser
* Handwriting-to-text
* Ability to search handwriting
* Integration with Apple services (calendar, reminders, sharing, etc.)

## Known issues:
* Drawing becomes sluggish when many strokes on a page

### TODO:
* Add a smart-snapshot feature that takes the strokes in a specific box on the canvas and displays them on the calendar cell
